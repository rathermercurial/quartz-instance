**Patterns** are combinations of [Practices](lexicon/Practices.md) and [Protocols](lexicon/Protocols.md) used, often according to [Frameworks](lexicon/Frameworks.md), to compose [Primitives](lexicon/Primitives.md) into implementations of organizational tooling.

## Tag Content for #patterns
- The DAO Primitive Model is a set of design #primitives and #patterns for building DAOs as purpose aligned networks of small autonomous teams. It includes a set of un-opinionated building blocks (primitives) out of which a DAO structure can be designed. These primitives allow for the deliberate design of governance and operational systems that can coherently scale as the activities of the DAO grow in size and complexity. [[notes/primitives-project/framework/index]]
- A **library** of coordination #patterns and software #modules with which the above organisational designs can be reliably implemented. For novel governance mechanisms to be tried and begin to succeed, having well tested combinations of social patterns and technical tools to deliver them is going to be crucially important. As more experiments are conducted the pattern library will flesh out the emerging best practice for achieving different organisational dynamics. [[notes/primitives-project/framework/index]]
