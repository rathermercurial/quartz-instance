**Group State** is a [group property](notes/primitives-project/framework/group-properties/index.md#^6009b0) referring to.. ^d95766

[index](notes/primitives-project/framework/group-properties/index.md) often publish their [state](notes/primitives-project/framework/group-properties/state.md) in a [Nucleus](lexicon/Nucleus.md) document to help #agents understand the #organization .

## Definition

Group State makes decentralised #organization possible, because entities and groups can be autonomous/self governing, while also being deeply integrated into larger networks and partnerships via agreements held in their _state._

Group state is also fractal, with Roles and Tasks also having _state_, which rolls up into Cell _states_, and Cell _states_ rolls up into DAO state. In this way, the entire network can be understood simply by looking at the the different group _states_ that it is made up of. 

## Expressions of Group State

- OpenCivics has created a similar approach to project legibility in their [OpenCivics Collaborative Initiative – Specification Template](library/OpenCivics%20Collaborative%20Initiative%20–%20Specification%20Template.md)
