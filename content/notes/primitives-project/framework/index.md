The DAO primitives facilitation framework is a work in progress. It is designed to provide a structure for designing organisational forms based on the DAO primitives that can be implemented using reliable organisational patterns from the Pattern Library.

The framework will help an external facilitator or a team themselves to work through a set of questions that will reveal the design of the core organisational structure (what the team, organisation is designed to be and do) and the basic agreements that will govern its members and relationships.

From design and set of agreements we can choose from the pattern library the different social processes and technical tool-sets that the organisational structure (team, DAO etc) will use to implement the above design and agreements.

## Framing

### Tools

#### [Frameworks](lexicon/Frameworks.md)\

something about frameworks..

Frameworks can be most useful to system designers, implementers, facilitators and learners, but can often be overwhelming to those looking to use the framework to build a mission-critical implementation. It's important to derive practical, case-specific instructions (such as [Playbooks](lexicon/Playbooks.md)) from frameworks which are intended to help everyday humans solve real-world problems.

#### [patterns](notes/primitives-project/patterns/patterns.md)

Patterns are typically composed of:

- [Practices](lexicon/Practices.md)
- [Protocols](lexicon/Protocols.md)
- [Primitives](lexicon/Primitives.md)

#### Implementations 

### Concepts Related to Primitives

For practical purposes, these concepts are loosely organized in alignment with the [REA ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resources%2C_Events%2C_Agents) for information systems. It's not that important, so feel free to remix them however you like.

- **Resources**
	- Roles #roles
		- Responsibilities
			- Tasks
			- Functions
		- Authorities
			- Permissions #permissions 
			- Compensation
		- Eligibility
		- Accountability
- **Events**
	- Agreements #agreements  
	- Transactions
- **Agents** #agents

# Facilitation layer

 As a starting point for the facilitation process we can use a process like **[The Ready's OS canvas](https://www.theready.com/os-canvas).** This provides a simple starting set of questions to outline the desired set organisational relationships and functions. From here the appropriate patterns from the pattern library can be chosen to implement these.

- Start to work through key questions about purpose and basic agreements (using something like the Ready's OS canvas). This will lead into choosing primitives that will do the job

- State (a basket of attestations) - the one primitive that will always be needed. If this stuff is not explicit then everything breaks down.

  - Purpose Practice and Progress

  - Define them, attest to them in some way, and agree



- DAOs

- Cells

- Roles
