**Group State** is a [group property](tags/groups/index.md#^6009b0) referring to.. ^d95766

## Definition

Group State makes decentralised #organization possible, because entities and groups can be autonomous/self governing, while also being deeply integrated into larger networks and partnerships via agreements held in their _state._

Group state is also fractal, with Roles and Tasks also having _state_, which rolls up into Cell _states_, and Cell _states_ rolls up into DAO state. In this way, the entire network can be understood simply by looking at the the different group _states_ that it is made up of.

## Elements of Group State

The state of a group may be described using any number and type of elements. We generally organize these into three categories: #purpose, #practices and #progress.

### [Purpose](notes/dao-primitives/Purpose)

- Goals
- Values
- 

### [Practices](notes/dao-primitives/Practices)

- Objectives
- 

### Progress



## Expressions of Group State

- OpenCivics has created a similar approach to project legibility in their [OpenCivics Collaborative Initiative – Specification Template](library/OpenCivics%20Collaborative%20Initiative%20–%20Specification%20Template.md)
