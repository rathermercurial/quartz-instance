[Anticapture](https://spengrah.mirror.xyz/f6bZ6cPxJpP-4K_NB7JcjbU0XblJcaf7kVLD75dOYRQ) is a framework for designing decentralized governance systems that resist monopolization and corruption by distributing decision-making power across autonomous agents.

## Summary

Anticapture is designed to combat *governance capture*, where individuals or groups monopolize shared resources for selfish gain. Traditional governance relies on hierarchical trust models, which are vulnerable to corruption. In contrast, Anticapture aims to develop capture-resistant governance by decentralizing decision-making and execution of actions. By distributing power and using cryptographic protections, this model creates resilient governance systems, ideal for DAOs and decentralized communities.

### Key Elements of the Framework

- **Agents and Networks**: Agents are individuals or groups that take actions. Anticapture views organizations as networks of these agents. Strong agent relationships can prevent capture, but weak or anonymous relationships require more robust protections.
- **Shared Resources**: These are assets controlled by networks of agents. Shared resources are vulnerable to internal and external capture. Anticapture defines different types of resources (e.g., financial, social) and emphasizes the importance of decentralized control.
- **Actions and Phases**: Governance is achieved through actions, which are divided into four phases—**Propose**, **Decide**, **Execute**, and **Evaluate**. Decentralizing the execution phase is key to resisting internal capture, while ensuring autonomy during execution helps avoid external capture.
- **Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs)**: Anticapture considers DAOs a strong form of capture-resistant governance. DAOs decentralize execution and ensure that only internal agents can take actions affecting shared resources. This makes DAOs resistant to both internal and external capture attempts.

The Anticapture framework’s structure revolves around four key phases that work together to create resilient and decentralized governance. Here's a detailed breakdown of each phase:

#### 1. **Propose**
This phase involves introducing an idea or action for the community to consider. The proposal can be made by any agent within the network, but this process must be designed to prevent dominance by any one party. Mechanisms for limiting who can propose, or ensuring broad input from the community, help prevent capture at this stage. Transparency and accessibility are emphasized here to ensure everyone can participate in governance.

#### 2. **Decide**
Once a proposal is made, the network must decide whether to move forward. The decision-making process can vary in complexity—from simple majority voting to more sophisticated consensus mechanisms. The Anticapture framework focuses on ensuring that the decision phase is decentralized and fair. It prevents manipulation by diversifying decision power among many agents, minimizing the risk of capture. Key features of this phase include quorum rules, anonymous voting, and weighted decision-making based on contribution or reputation.

#### 3. **Execute**
In this phase, the approved proposal is carried out. Anticapture focuses heavily on ensuring that the execution of decisions is decentralized. This means no single agent or small group can monopolize the execution process. The framework proposes dividing responsibilities across different agents and ensuring autonomous execution mechanisms (like smart contracts in DAOs) to reduce reliance on any individual. Decentralizing execution protects the system from internal capture by preventing any agent from sabotaging or altering the proposal’s implementation.

#### 4. **Evaluate**
After execution, the final phase is evaluation, where the impact of the decision is reviewed. This phase is vital for accountability and ensuring continuous improvement of the governance system. Feedback loops, public reporting, and transparent audits of actions are used to hold agents accountable and ensure that the community can assess whether the executed actions aligned with the proposal’s goals. Evaluation also allows the community to identify areas of vulnerability to future capture and improve processes for the next governance cycle.

#### Implementing Anticapture

The elements of the Anticapture framework—Propose, Decide, Execute, and Evaluate—can be combined into a cohesive governance system by following these steps:

1. **Propose**: Open the floor for proposals from agents within the network, ensuring inclusivity and transparency. Rules may determine who can propose and how proposals are formatted.
   
2. **Decide**: Use decentralized decision-making processes like voting, consensus mechanisms, or weighted input to approve or reject proposals. Mechanisms like quorum requirements or reputation-based voting can safeguard against manipulation.

3. **Execute**: Decentralize the implementation of decisions to ensure that no single agent can dominate or sabotage the process. This could involve smart contracts or multi-party execution agreements that autonomously carry out the approved proposal.

4. **Evaluate**: After execution, implement continuous feedback loops to assess the success of the action. This phase involves audits, reports, and transparent communication with the community. Evaluations should be used to refine the process and mitigate risks of future capture attempts.

By ensuring decentralization and accountability at every step, the governance system becomes resilient against both internal and external threats of capture.
